Recursion - When a function calls itself untill a specified condition is met.
Recursion is a common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself. This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result.

Stack Overflow - A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The function calls itself with no way to stop.*/ This leads to segmenation fault.

Base Case - The condition when the recursion ends. The base case is a condition that stops the recursive function from calling itself. It is a condition that stops the recursion.*/
